This wiki is less of a wiki, and more notable things I've found and considered documenting for posterity, just in case anyone picks this up or fancies creating their own app or service (God help them).

Obviously what you read here is subject to change, but unlikely to see anything major beyond additions. Bandcamp is a large company and changing their stack around now would be nuts.

I'd recommend checking [Items, Packages, Albums, and Tracks](https://github.com/har-nick/bandcamp-api-docs/wiki/Items,-Packages,-Albums,-and-Tracks) before [API Data and Its Usages](https://github.com/har-nick/bandcamp-api-docs/wiki/API-Data-and-Its-Usages), and then [API Endpoints](https://github.com/har-nick/bandcamp-api-docs/wiki/API-Endpoints).

For a Kotlin-based implementation, see my app [Troupetent](https://github.com/har-nick/troupetent).
